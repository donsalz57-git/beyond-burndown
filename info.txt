project = DEV and Summary !~ Capacity

This is Beyond Burndown™ Feasibility Gadget - a Jira Cloud dashboard gadget built on Atlassian Forge that provides physics-based feasibility analysis for project teams.       

  Core Purpose

  It answers: "Can we deliver the planned work with available capacity?"

  Main Features

  1. Feasibility Envelope Analysis - Spreads remaining estimates across business days and compares demand vs. capacity to identify overloaded periods
  2. Demand & Capacity Scoping - Configurable JQL queries to define what work needs to be done (demand) and what bandwidth is available (capacity)
  3. Compliance Engine - Detects planning violations:
    - Missing dates or estimates
    - Done issues with remaining work
    - Overdue issues
    - Child stories due after parent Epic
    - Dependency conflicts (predecessor finishing after successor starts)
  4. Dependency Modeling - Extracts blocking relationships from Jira issue links and detects circular dependencies
  5. Diagnostic Mode - Debug views showing raw data to verify live connectivity
